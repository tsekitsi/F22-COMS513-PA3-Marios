# Project 3: Building an automatic debugger

Submission by Marios Tsekitsidis

## How to run my code

First, install dependencies with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Implementation of delta debugging

I have implemented the delta debugging algorithm in python. Specifically, in main.py, inside the class `DeltaDebugger`, the method `dd2` directly implements the recursive function ddâ‚‚ of Algorithm 1 from Zeller, 1999. [TO-DO: <how to initialize a DeltaDebugger object, then you have to call the method dd>]

## Test case

I have used get_sign.c from Project 2 as my V1. In V2, I make 7 syntactically equivalent changes (which do not change the program's correctness) and one change that introduces a bug, which is the line:

```c
*(int*)0 = 0; // bug-inducing change
```

Adding this line to the program induces a segmentation fault.

Please read below the output of my main, which includes details of the changes between the correct (V1) and buggy (V2) versions, as well as the steps of the delta debugger execution.

```

As seen above, the debugger successfully singles-out change #7 as the minimal bug-inducing change from V1 to V2.
